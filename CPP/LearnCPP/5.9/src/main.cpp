#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void printString(std::string str) // str makes a copy of its initializer
{
    std::cout << str << '\n';
}

// When printString(s) is called, str makes an expensive copy of s. The function prints the copied string and then destroys it.

// Note that s is already holding the string we want to print. Could we just use the string that s is holding instead of making a copy? The answer is possibly -- there are three criteria we need to assess:

// Could s be destroyed while str is still using it? No, str dies at the end of the function, and s exists in the scope of the caller and can’t be destroyed before the function returns.
// Could s be modified while str is still using it? No, str dies at the end of the function, and the caller has no opportunity to modify the s before the function returns.
// Does str modify the string in some way that the caller would not expect? No, the function does not modify the string at all.
// Since all three of these criteria are false, there is no risk in using
// the string that s is holding instead of making a copy. And since
// string copies are expensive, why pay for one that we don’t need?
